# Advent of Code 2021

The Year of Emacs Lisp

Solutions are written as emacs lisp functions that can be interactively run on a buffer containing the problem input.


# Running Solutions

From the input.txt file

SPC SPC load-file [solution file]
SPC SPC [solution-function-name]

Some solutions will prompt for more input from the minibuffer, output sent to `*Messages*` buffer
